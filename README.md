PyCity Schools Analysis

The top 8 highest performing schools (by % Passing) were all charter schools. Conversely the bottom 7 performing schools (by % Passing) were all district schools.

Small schools (<1000) produced 89.9% passing students. Medium schools (1000 to 2000) produced 90.6% passing students. There was a huge drop for large schools (2000 to 5000) which only produced 58.2% passing students.

The most unexpected trend I found was the 'amount spent per student' vs '% Overall Passing'. There was a direct correlation for this. The schools who spent more on each student produced less overall passing students.

In summary: If you want your child to do well in school, help them with their homework, often. If you want your child to do well in school based on statistics alone, send them to a small to medium sized charter school who spends little (comparatively) on each student.
